    font-family:arial;">The Evolutionary College – our latest initiative</h2>
            <p>The Evolutionary College has a solid legacy of providing top quality education to successive generations since 1999,  with a vision of making quality education accessible to all cross-sections of society.
<br><br>
Following the remarkable success of The Evolutionary School, the Group is now launching a franchise-based network of Colleges to provide educational opportunities to the middle income strata of our society. With its distinctive benefits, The Smart College will serve as a link between Secondary and Higher Education. A large number of students are deprived of the opportunity to gain admission to quality, renowned institutions due to the shortage of such Colleges in Pakistan. The Evolutionary College fills this gap by providing top quality education and offering an opportunity to  students to secure an authentic and reliable certification or degree to pursue their chosen career path.
<br><br>
Along with academic excellence, we inculcate critical thinking through curricular and co-curricular activities, and instil in students the desire to become lifelong learners. To maximise their potential, we offer the students a standardised curriculum with well-structured co-curricular activities—such as tutorials, seminars, symposiums, debates, reading clubs, field trips, sports competitions and many other innovative initiatives. We l also provide e-learning competency through blended learning, our website, web portal.
<br><br>
We are living in the age of innovation and technology. To keep pace with the modern world, we  have introduced a state-of-the-art student management system to maintain records for each student and to provide updated information to parents regarding their students’ performance, attendance and results.
<br><br>
We look forward to a very close continuing liaison between parents, faculty and The Evolutionary College management.</p>
